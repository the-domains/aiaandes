## OUR SCHOOL

We are physically located in the scenic Andes, in Imbabura, Ecuador. Our location allows for local students to enjoy an experiential, hands-on education experience in a family atmosphere. Our co-op courses, small group classes, and other activities take place in the homes of our families and our teachers. We have a rather large "backyard" to explore with endless opportunities for outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, picnicking, boating, bird watching, etc.

For Students residing outside of the province of Imbabura, we offer online curriculum, tutoring, and virtual classes with our Ecuador-based, North-America certified teachers.
