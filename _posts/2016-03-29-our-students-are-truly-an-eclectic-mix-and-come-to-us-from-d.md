description: "Our students are truly an eclectic\_mix and come to us from diverse backgrounds. As a co-op, we have students who join us only for field trip activities, and we have others who do all of their schooling using the instructional services of our teachers. We have English and Spanish speaking students from Ecuador, North America, Asia, and occasionally short-term students from other parts of the world. Most of our students are middle-school age, but we offer educational\_opportunities\_for students in grades K-12. Our students have many chances to get together each month for thematic classes and field trips. We also offer select, multi-day Family Field Trips throughout the year to different parts of Ecuador.\_"

Our students are truly an eclectic mix and come to us from diverse backgrounds. As a co-op, we have students who join us only for field trip activities, and we have others who do all of their schooling using the instructional services of our teachers. We have English and Spanish speaking students from Ecuador, North America, Asia, and occasionally short-term students from other parts of the world. Most of our students are middle-school age, but we offer educational opportunities for students in grades K-12\. Our students have many chances to get together each month for thematic classes and field trips. We also offer select, multi-day Family Field Trips throughout the year to different parts of Ecuador.
