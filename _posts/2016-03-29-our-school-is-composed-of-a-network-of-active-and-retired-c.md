## OUR TEACHERS

Our school is composed of a network of active and retired, certified or highly qualified teachers available to work with students in-person or online in core subjects of English language arts, mathematics, reading, science, and social studies at all grade levels PK-12\. Our local Spanish language teachers are experienced in working with children in an immersion model (meaning little to no English is used in teaching Spanish). We also frequently have guest teachers from around the world who offer a free 1-2 hour weekly elective to students enrolled in any of our services (Supervisory, Core Courses, Field Trips, CAP).
